## Comments on today
> It was a nice day. The sun was out with no rain. I walked Moose and played with him in the backyard. My girlfriend won a compounding contest, which she hoped was going to happen. I bought some stonks without realizing that it was the _perfect time_ to buy them. 

>> It's great when hindsight 20/20 is on your side, am I right?
